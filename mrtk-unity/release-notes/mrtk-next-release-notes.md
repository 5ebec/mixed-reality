# Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit vNext Release Notes

## What's new in vNext

### Added Experience Settings and an associated Mixed Reality Scene Content behavior

Users can now configure [Experience Settings](../features/experience-settings/experience-settings.md), which will allow MRTK to display [Mixed Reality Scene Content](../features/experience-settings/scene-content.md)
appropriately based on the targeted experience.

### Teleport Hotspot added

A new teleport hotspot component has been graduated. You can add a teleport hotspot to your gameobject to ensure that the user is in a certain position and orientation when they teleport to that location.
