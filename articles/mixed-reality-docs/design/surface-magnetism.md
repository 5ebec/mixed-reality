# Surface magnetism

![Surface magnetism](images/MRTK_SurfaceMagnetism.gif)

Using the surface magnetism technique, you can place a holographic object on a real-world physical surface. By aligning the object's orientation with the real-world surface, you can create a more immersive and natural experience for the user.

## Surface magnetism in MRTK (Mixed Reality Toolkit) for Unity
**[MRTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity)** provides scripts and example scenes for the surface magnetism technique. You can use surface magnetism with various types of inputs such as hand-ray, eye gaze, and motion controllers.

* [MRTK - Spatial awareness + Surface magnetism example scenes](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/blob/mrtk_development/Assets/MixedRealityToolkit.Examples/Demos/Solvers/Scenes/SurfaceMagnetismSpatialAwarenessExample.unity)
