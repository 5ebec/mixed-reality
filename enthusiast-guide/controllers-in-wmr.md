# Controllers in Windows Mixed Reality

Windows Mixed Reality is designed to work best with mixed reality motion controllers, which provide natural, precise interactions with no need to install hardware on your walls.

You can also use an Xbox controller or a mouse and keyboard. And remember, you can always get around in mixed reality [using just your voice](using-speech-in-wmr.md).

## Motion controller setup

Most headsets come pre-paired directly to the headset, but some early headsets require the motion controllers to be paired to your PC with Bluetooth 4.0. When you connect your immersive headset for the first time, you'll be walked through turning on your motion controllers during setup. But if you need to re-pair them later on, here’s how: 

1. Launch **Mixed Reality Portal** with your headset connected.  
2. In the lower-left corner select **… > Pair controllers**.  
3. Insert 2 AA batteries into each controller and follow the instructions provided on-screen.

> [!NOTE]
> * For controllers that pair directly to your PC, you’ll need to put them into pairing mode by turning them on and then pressing the pairing button inside the battery compartment until the lights start flashing.  
> 
> * Motion controllers only support being paired to one computer or PC at a time. If you need to use them with a different headset, you’ll need to go through the pairing process .

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Got an Xbox controller?** 
> 
> If you have a Bluetooth Xbox controller, pair it with your PC to use it with your headset. Learn how. <!-- NEED NON-CIRCULAR LINK -->.
> 
> If you have a wired Xbox controller, plug it in to your PC.
> 
> Some games and apps use the Xbox controller differently from how it's used in mixed reality. To use the controller for a game or app, select **Use as gamepad** on the app bar or say, "Use as gamepad." To switch the controller back to mixed reality, select **Use as gamepad**, again, or say, "Use with gaze."  

## Using controllers

Here’s how to get around in mixed reality with motion controllers, an Xbox gamepad, or a mouse and keyboard.

Your controller communicates to you what it's doing by vibrating and blinking its LED lights. 

|  When your controller does this  |  It means this | 
| --- | --- |
| LEDs turn on, and the controller vibrates once | **Turning on** |  
| LEDs turn off, and the controller vibrates twice | **Turning off** |
| LEDs blink every 3 seconds | **Sleeping** |
| LEDs slowly pulse, and the controller vibrates once | **Entering pairing mode** |
| Controller vibrates once | **Connecting or disconnecting from your PC** |
| LEDs are brightly lit | **Controllers tracked by headset** |
| LEDs are dimly lit | **Controllers not tracked by headset** |
| Controller vibrates three times and then turns off | **Critical battery level** |
| The outer and inner rings of LEDs blink in an alternating pattern | **Updating** |
