# Windows Mixed Reality Setup FAQ

Here’s some info to help troubleshoot problems you might run into when you set up your Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset.

## I get a message that says “We couldn’t download the Window Mixed Reality software,” or setup is stuck on the “Hang tight while we do some downloading” page.

Try the following:
* Go to **Settings  > Update & security > Windows Update** and make sure Windows Update is turned on. Then, download and install any updates that are waiting to be installed.
* Make sure your PC is connected to the internet and has at least 2GB of free storage space.
* Restart your PC and try again.

> [!NOTE]
> * If you're on an enterprise managed network, check with your administrator. They might need to enable Windows Mixed Reality. Looking for the IT pro instructions? See **[this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/application-management/manage-windows-mixed-reality)**.
> * If your Wi-Fi network connection is set to metered, change it to unmetered. **[Learn more](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4028458)**

## I get a message that says "Something went wrong, and we couldn't start Windows Mixed Reality."

Try the following:
1. Unplug your headset from your computer (both cables).
2. Restart your computer.
3. Go **Settings  > Update & security > Windows Update** and make sure Windows Update is turned on. Then, download and install any updates that are waiting to be installed.
4. Reconnect your headset to the computer, then try setup again.

If the above steps don’t work, try uninstalling and then reinstalling Windows Mixed Reality. Go to **Settings  > Mixed reality > Uninstall** and select **Uninstall**. Then restart your computer. To start the setup process again, just plug your headset into your PC.

## I get a message that says my PC can’t run Windows Mixed Reality.

If you get this message, your PC doesn’t meet the [minimum requirements](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4039260) needed to run Windows Mixed Reality. This could be because the computer’s hardware setup isn’t compatible with Windows Mixed Reality, or because you need to [update to the latest version of Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12373).

Notes on graphics cards:

* If Windows Mixed Reality setup says your graphics card doesn’t meet the requirements and you think it does, make sure your headset is plugged into the correct card.
* Check with your graphics card manufacturer for the latest driver update. Windows Mixed Reality requires a graphics card driver that supports at least WDDM 2.2.

## I get a message that says, “You’re nearly there—this PC doesn’t meet the minimum requirements needed to run Windows Mixed Reality.”

If you get this message, your PC doesn’t meet the minimum requirements needed for the best experience in Windows Mixed Reality. Your PC may be able to run an immersive headset, but may not be able to run certain apps or might have problems with performance.

## My Xbox controller isn’t working.

Try the following:

* Make sure your controller is turned on, fully charged, and connected to the PC.
* Replace the controller’s batteries.
* If you're using a Bluetooth controller, go to **Settings  > Devices > Bluetooth & other devices** on your PC and make sure it's paired (you should see it listed on the page).

## My motion controllers aren't working.
 
Try the following:

* Make sure your controllers are turned on and fully charged.
* Replace the controllers’ batteries.
* Turn the controllers off and on again while holding them in front of you. Press and hold the Windows  button for 4 seconds to turn a controller off, then press and hold it again for 2 seconds to turn it on. 
* Go to **Settings  > Devices > Bluetooth & other devices** on your PC and make sure they’re paired (you should see them listed on the page).

## I get a message that says, “Connect your headset” even though I’ve plugged in my headset

Try the following:

* Make sure your headset is connected to the correct ports on your computer. It should be plugged into the PC’s discrete graphics card and a USB 3.0 port. Here's how to identify the correct ports:
    * USB 3.0 ports have a special logo with an "SS" mark (indicating "SuperSpeed"). The port's inside piece is normally blue, whereas older USB 2.0 ports are typically black or white on the inside.
    * If your computer has two HDMI ports, use the one that connects to the graphics card, not the computer's motherboard. It's not always obvious which is which, though discrete ports are often located in an expansion slot on the computer. If you try one port and it doesn't work, try the other.
* Go to the headset manufacturer’s website and update the drivers and firmware for your headset.

## I get an error message when I try to create a boundary.

Here are some guidelines for creating a boundary:

* Don’t get too close to a wall or other obstruction.
* Make sure to hold your headset at waist height, and face toward your computer while you trace the boundary.
* Make sure the sensor isn’t blocked and there’s enough light.
* The space you’re tracing should be larger than 3 square meters.
* The space should not be too large or too complicated—stick to a simple geometric shape without a lot of twists and turns.
* Don’t cross back over your own path as you’re tracing.
* If you get stuck in a corner, start over.

**If I choose “Seated and standing only,” what type of experience will I have?**

“Seated and standing only” means you’ll be using your headset without a boundary. You’ll need to stay in one place, as you’ll have no boundary to help you avoid physical obstacles. Also, some apps and games may be designed to be used with a boundary, so they might not work as intended.

## How can I get a clearer view in my headset?

Try adjusting the fit of your headset. Adjust its position on your face by moving it up and down or left and right, and adjust the straps so it feels snug.

If your headset supports it, you can also adjust its calibration settings. If the headset has a knob to adjust calibration, use that. If it doesn’t, go to **Settings  > Mixed reality > Visual quality** and adjust the calibration there. For more information on calibration for your specific device, check with your headset manufacturer.

## What languages are supported in Windows Mixed Reality?

Windows Mixed Reality is available in the following languages. If your PC is set to a different language, you can still use Windows Mixed Reality, but the interface will appear in English (United States), and speech commands and dictation won't be available.

* Chinese Simplified (China)
* English (Australia)
* English (Canada)
* English (Great Britain)
* English (United States)
* French (Canada)
* French (France)
* German (Germany)
* Italian (Italy)
* Japanese (Japan)
* Spanish (Mexico)
* Spanish (Spain)

The Windows Mixed Reality on-screen keyboard is English (United States) only. To enter text in another language, use a physical keyboard connected to your PC. You can also use dictation in one of the supported Windows Mixed Reality languages listed above—just select **microphone**  on the on-screen keyboard.

Windows Mixed Reality is also available in the following languages without speech commands or dictation features:

* Chinese Traditional (Taiwan and Hong Kong)
* Dutch (Netherlands)
* Korean (Korea)
* Russian (Russia)

## When I plug in my headset, nothing happens—Mixed Reality Portal doesn’t open.

Mixed Reality Portal, the app that takes you through Windows Mixed Reality setup, is designed to open automatically when you plug in a compatible headset. If it doesn’t open, go to **Start** and type **Mixed Reality Portal** in the **Search**  box to open the app from there. If you can’t find Mixed Reality Portal, that might mean you need to [update to the latest version of Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12373).

## I can’t hear any sound in my headset, or sound is playing through my computer.

If your immersive headset doesn’t include built-in headphones, you’ll need to connect headphones to the audio jack on the headset. (The jack is often located just behind the headset visor or lenses; check with your headset manufacturer if you have trouble finding it.) 

Some audio headsets have physical buttons to control the volume. If audio isn't working, check to see whether the volume is turned down or muted.

Windows Mixed Reality is designed to play sound through your immersive headset when you’re wearing it and have headphones connected to it. When you take the headset off or flip the visor up, audio will switch to your default Windows playback device. You can change this setting in **Settings  > Mixed reality > Audio and speech**.

> [!NOTE]
> * Windows Mixed Reality spatial audio works best with headphones built into or connected directly to your immersive headset. PC speakers or headphones connected to the PC might not work well for spatial audio.
> * Windows Mixed Reality doesn’t support Bluetooth audio headsets.

## Speech commands aren’t working.

To use Speech commands, your PC’s speech and language settings must be set to one of the [languages](#what-languages-are-supported-in-windows-mixed-reality) supported in Windows Mixed Reality. To check this, go to **Settings  > Time & language > Region & language** and **Settings  > Time & language > Speech**.

If your headset doesn’t have a built-in mic, you’ll need to attach headphones with a mic to the headset or to your PC. To have mic input switch automatically to your headset when you wear it, go to **Settings  > Mixed reality > Audio and speech**, and make sure that **When I wear my headset, switch to headset mic** is turned on.

Some audio headsets have a physical button to mute and unmute the microphone. If Speech commands aren't working, check to see whether your mic is muted.

## My head mount display doesn't work after I shut down and do a fast startup.

Try this:

* Unplug the HDMI cable and the USB cable from the head mount display and then plug them back in.

## My Wi-Fi slows down when I use Windows Mixed Reality

If you're using a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi connection, your motion controllers might slow down your Wi-Fi. Try one of the following:

* Switch to a 5 GHz Wi-Fi connection, if one is available. Learn more
* Use a separate Bluetooth adapter to connect your motion controllers to your PC. [See recommended adapters](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4039260)
