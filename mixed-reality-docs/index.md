# Understand the basics

I’m brand new to mixed reality. I would like to learn about what it is and understand its capabilities.



![mixed reality spectrum](images/RWtpZ1.jpeg)

## What is mixed reality?


### [Mixed reality is a spectrum](mixed-reality.md)
Mixed reality is the result of blending the physical world with the digital world. Mixed reality is the next evolution in human, computer, and environment interaction and unlocks possibilities that before now were restricted to our imaginations.

<br>


### [What is a hologram?](hologram.md)
HoloLens lets you create holograms, objects made of light and sound that appear in the world around you, just as if they were real objects. Holograms respond to your gaze, gestures and voice commands, and can interact with real-world surfaces around you. With holograms, you can create digital objects that are part of your world.

## What can you do with mixed reality?

### [A new vision for work](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/mixed-reality/overview/)
Internally at Microsoft we are creating mixed reality applications to empower employees and optimize operations. The Dynamics 365 team has worked on a range of projects that demonstrate the possibilities: Remote Assist, Layout and Guides.
<br>

### [The pursuit of more personal computing](case-study-the-pursuit-of-more-personal-computing.md)
Tomorrow’s opportunities are uncovered by building products today. The solutions these products provide reveal what’s necessary to advance the future. With mixed reality this is especially true: Meaningful insight comes from getting hands-on with real work — real devices, real customers, real problems.

        Philips is piloting HoloLens in the domain of image-guided minimally invasive procedures, during which physicians rely on live X-ray, ultrasound and other sources of information to "see" inside the patient and guide their actions.

## What are the capabilities of HoloLens?

### [Immersive, ergonomic, instinctual and untethered](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/hardware)

HoloLens 2 offers the most comfortable and immersive mixed reality experience available, with industry-leading solutions that deliver value in minutes—all enhanced by the reliability, security, and scalability of cloud and AI services from Microsoft.

![distance guide](images/text_in_unity_viewingangle.jpg)

## What are the core concepts of an experience?

### [Keep the user comfortable - (Comfort)](comfort.md)
To ensure maximum comfort on head-mounted displays, it’s important for designers and developers to create and present content in a way that mimics how these cues operate in the natural world.

<br>

### [How the user sees the world - (Holographic frame)](holographic-frame.md)
Users see the world of mixed reality through a rectangular viewport powered by their headset. On the HoloLens, this rectangular area is called the holographic frame and allows users to see digital content overlaid onto the real world around them.

<br>

### [Making holographic objects feel real - (Spatial mapping)](spatial-mapping.md)
Spatial mapping makes it possible to place objects on real surfaces. This helps anchor objects in the user's world and takes advantage of real world depth cues.

<br>

### [Suggesting the scale of an object - (Scale)](scale.md)
A key to displaying content that looks realistic in holographic form is to mimic the visual statistics of the real world as closely as possible. This means incorporating as many of the visual cues as we can that help us (in the real world) understand where objects are, how big they are, and what they’re made of.
