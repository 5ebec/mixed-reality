# Immersive headset hardware details

**Big news: Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets and motion controllers [will launch alongside the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/09/01/create-and-play-this-holiday-with-the-windows-10-fall-creators-update-coming-oct-17) on October 17, 2017!**

A limited number of Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset dev kits are available for developers to order through the [online Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collections/VRandMixedrealityheadsets?cat0=devices&icid=VRMR-Cat-HLG03-Windows_Mixed_Reality-08022017-en_US). These immersive headsets deliver built-in inside-out tracking, meaning there is no need to purchase or install external trackers or place sensors on the wall. There's no complicated setup, just plug and play.
