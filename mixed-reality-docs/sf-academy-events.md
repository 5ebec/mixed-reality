### February 12, 2019
Join us at our next Non-Gaming XR meetup for presentations, discussion, demos, and networking centered around exploring how immersive technologies are being applied to the construction, architecture and engineering industries.
During the presentations, we'll learn from leading companies as they share best enterprise use cases and share how VR/AR above other technologies are providing the best solutions for the growing needs of the AEC market.

## Mixed Reality Workgroup
### February 13, 2019
As a workgroup, we want to keep things pretty casual, just show up around 6:00, hang out and work for a while! It's a great opportunity to get feedback from other developers, seek out help and advice from someone who's tried it before, or chill for a while after work and code!
So bring a laptop, bring a project, and bring an open mind! The Microsoft Reactor is a roomy place, and we're keeping attendance limited so it's not a busy crowd. We hope to see you there! :)
