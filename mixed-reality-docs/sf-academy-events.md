## **[Mixed Reality Workgroup, San Francisco Reactor](https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meetup.com%2Fhololens-mr%2F&data=02%7C01%7Cdaescu%40microsoft.com%7Ca8ddee063b7949a9992308d6903e62b0%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636854994961124360&sdata=YmnAAiWVxIJ700mO9gj%2BOz4W8%2BgKDjDhiJhYtfCzCFU%3D&reserved=0)**
### February 25, 2019
As a workgroup, we want to keep things pretty casual, just show up around 6:00, hang out and work for a while! It's a great opportunity to get feedback from other developers, seek out help and advice from someone who's tried it before, or chill for a while after work and code! So bring a laptop, bring a project, and bring an open mind! The Microsoft Reactor is a roomy place, and we're keeping attendance limited so it's not a busy crowd. We hope to see you there!
