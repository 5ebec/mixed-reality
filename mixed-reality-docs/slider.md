# Slider

![Slider](images/UX/UX_Hero_Slider.jpg)

Sliders are UI components that allow you to continuously change a value by moving a slider on a track. The Pinch Slider can be moved by directly grabbing the slider, either directly or at a distance. Sliders work with various input types such as gaze and air-tap as well as the motion controller.
