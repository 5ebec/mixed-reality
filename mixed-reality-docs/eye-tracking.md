# Eye Tracking on HoloLens 2

> More information coming soon!

HoloLens 2 enables detecting what a user is looking at. Eye tracking enables applications to track where the user is looking in real time.  This is the main capability developers can leverage to enable a whole new level of context and human understanding within the Holographic experience. The eye tracking algorithm provides the following to applications through our API: 

1.	Timestamp, 
2.	Eye gaze origin (only one combined for left and right eye), 
3.	Eye gaze direction (again this is combined for left and right eye), 
4.	Boolean whether the gaze is valid. 

For eye tracking to work accurately, each user is required to go through an Eye Tracking user calibration.
