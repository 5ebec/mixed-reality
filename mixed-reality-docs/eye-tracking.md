# Eye Tracking on HoloLens 2

> More information coming soon!

HoloLens 2 enables detecting what a user is looking at. Eye tracking enables applications to track where the user is looking in real time.  This is the main capability developers can leverage to enable a whole new level of context and human understanding within the Holographic experience. The eye tracking algorithm provides the following to applications through our API: 

1.	Timestamp, 
2.	Eye gaze origin (only one combined for left and right eye), 
3.	Eye gaze direction (again this is combined for left and right eye), 
4.	Boolean whether the gaze is valid. 

For eye tracking to work accurately, each user is required to go through an Eye Tracking user calibration.

## Use cases
Eye tracking enables applications and the Shell to track where the user is looking in real time. This will enable a whole new level of context and human understanding within the Holographic experience. This section describes the types of new interactions that become possible with eye tracking.

### User intent	    
-	Context for other inputs such as voice, hands and controllers
-	Fast and low-effort target selections
-	Engagement with embodied virtual agents and interactive holograms	

### Attention tracking	 
-	Remote eye gaze visualization
-	User research studies 
-	Training simulations
-	Performance monitoring
-	Design evaluations, advertisement and marketing research
-	Medical and educational research / applications	

### Implicit actions	 
-	Automatic scroll and pan
-	Smart notifications
-	Attentive holograms that react when being looked at	

### Expressiveness	 
-	Live avatar eye animation
-	Gaze direction and blinks	

### Gaming 	 
-	Additional targeting vector
-	Superpowers! 	

### Text entry 	 
-	Smarter and low-effort text entry (especially useful when speech or hands are inconvenient to use)
