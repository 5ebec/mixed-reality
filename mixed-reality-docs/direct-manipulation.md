# Direct manipulation
Direct manipulation is an input model that involves touching holograms directly with your hands.  The goal with direct manipulation is that objects behave just as they do in the real world. Buttons can be activated simply by pressing them, objects can be picked up by grabbing them, and 2D content behaves like a virtual touchscreen.  Because of this, direct manipulation is easy for users to learn, and it's fun too.  It is considered a "near" input model, meaning it is best used for interacting with content that is within arms reach.

A key ingredient that makes direct manipulation easy to learn is that it is affordance-based. There are no symbolic gestures to teach users. All interactions should be built around a visual element that can be touched or grabbed.
