# Computer Vision Applications for Mixed Reality Headsets
TBC.

## Overview

Mixed reality headsets are becoming powerful platforms to develop computer vision applications. 
One example is given by the Microsoft HoloLens headset. HoloLens Research Mode gives access to all raw image sensor streams -- including depth and IR --  to enable computer vision research on device.

As Research Mode is now available since last May, we are starting to see several interesting computer vision demos and applications being developed for HoloLens.
The goal of this workshop is to bring together students and researchers interested in this topic, both enabling them to share their demos and applications, learn from each other and enable others to benefit from their insights to build or port their own applications to mixed reality.

We encourage submissions on the topics of (ego-centric) object recognition, hand and user tracking, activity recognition, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, scene understanding, sensor-based localization, navigation and more.

## Important Dates
- Paper submission deadline: TBD.
- Notification to authors: TBD.
- Camera ready deadline: TBD.

## Schedule
