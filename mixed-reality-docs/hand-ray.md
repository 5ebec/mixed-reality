A button has long been a metaphor used for triggering an event in the 2D abstract world. In the three-dimensional mixed reality world, we donâ€™t have to be confined to this world of abstraction anymore. Anything can be an **interactable object** that triggers an event. An interactable object can be represented as anything from a coffee cup on the table to a balloon floating in the air. We still do make use of traditional buttons in certain situation such as in dialog UI. The visual representation of the button depends on the context.
