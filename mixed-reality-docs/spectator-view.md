# Spectator View for HoloLens and HoloLens 2

![Marker](images/SpecViewPhoneHero.jpg)

## Overview

When wearing a HoloLens, we often forget that a person who does not have it on is unable to experience the wonders that we can. Spectator View allows others to see on a 2D screen what a HoloLens user sees in their world.
Spectator View offers a fast and affordable approach to recording holograms in HD with mobile devices. It also offers a professional quality recording of holograms with DSLR cameras.

The following table shows both options and their capabilities. Choose the option that best fits your video recording needs:
