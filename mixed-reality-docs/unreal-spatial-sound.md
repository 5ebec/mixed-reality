# Spatial Audio in Unreal

## Overview

Unlike vision, humans hear in 360 degree surround sound. Spatial sound emulates how human hearing works, providing the cues needed to identify sound locations in world-space. When you add spatial soundâ€¯in your mixed reality applications, you're enhancing the level of immersion your users experience.  

High quality spatial sound processing is complex, so the HoloLens 2 comes with dedicated hardware for processing those sound objects.  Before you can access this hardware processing support, you'll need to install the **MicrosoftSpatialSound** plugin in your Unreal project. This article will walk you through the installation and configuration of that plugin and point you towards more in-depth resources for using spatial sound in the Unreal engine. 

## Installing the Microsoft Spatial Sound plugin 

The first step to adding spatial sound to your project is installing the Microsoft Spatial Sound plugin, which you can find by: 

* Clicking **Edit > Plugins** and searching for **MicrosoftSpatialSound** in the search box. 
* Selecting the **Enabled** checkbox in the **MicrosoftSpatialSound** plugin. 
* Restarting the Unreal Editor by selecting **Restart Now** from the plugins page. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't already, you'll need to install the **Microsoft Windows Mixed Reality** and **HoloLens** plugins by following the instructions in the **[Initializing your project](unreal-uxt-ch2.md)** section of our Unreal tutorial series.

Once the editor restarts, your project is all set!


## Setting the spatialization plugin for HoloLens 2 platform
Configuring the spatialization plugin is done on a per-platform basis.  You can enable the Microsoft Spatial Sound plugin for the HoloLens 2 by:
1. Selecting **Edit > Project Settings**, scrolling to **Platforms** and clicking **HoloLens**.
2. Expanding the **Audio** properties and setting the **Spatialization Plugin** field to **Microsoft Spatial Sound**.

If you're going to be previewing your application in the Unreal editor on a desktop PC, you'll need to repeat the above steps for the **Windows** platform:

## Enabling spatial audio on your workstation
Spatial audio is disabled by default on desktop versions of Windows. You can enable it by:
* Right-clicking on the **volume** icon in the task bar. 
    + Choose **Spatial sound -> Windows Sonic for Headphones** to get the best representation of what you'll hear on HoloLens 2.

> [!NOTE]
>This setting is only required if you plan to test your project in the Unreal editor.

## Creating Attenuation objects
After you've installed and configured the necessary plugins:
* Search for an **Ambient Sound** actor in the **Place Actors** window and hit Enter to place it in the scene.

* Make the **Ambient Sound** actor a child of a visual element in your scene. 
    * An Ambient Sound actor doesn't have any visual representation by default, so you'll only hear a sound from its position in the scene. Attaching it to a visual element let's you see and move the actor like any other asset.

To create a sound attenuation asset:
*  Right-click on the **Content Browser** and selecting **Create Advanced Asset -> Sounds -> Sound Attenuation**:

* Then switch the **Spatialization Method** to **Binaural**.

Putting it all together:
* Select the **Ambient Sound** actor and scroll down to the **Attenuation** section in the **Details** panel. 
    * Set the **Attenuation Settings** property to the **Sound Attenuation** asset you created.

Once all of this is configured the ambient sound can be spatialized using the dedicated hardware offload support on HoloLens 2.

## Configuring objects for spatialization
Working with spatial audio means you're in charge of managing how sound behaves in a virtual environment. Your main focus is creating sound objects that appear louder when the user is close, and quieter when the user is far away. This is referred to as sound attenuation, making sounds appear as if they are positioned in a fixed spot.

> [!NOTE]
> Spatialization with the **Microsoft Spatial Sound** plugin will only work with SoundWave objects that are mono. Make sure that your audio files are correctly configured to mono before importing them into your project.

All attenuation objects come with modifiable settings for:
* Distance
* Spatialization
* Air Absorption
* Listener Focus
* Reverb Send
* Occlusion

[Sound attenuation in Unreal](https://docs.unrealengine.com/Engine/Audio/DistanceModelAttenuation/index.html) has details and implementation specifics on each of these topics.
