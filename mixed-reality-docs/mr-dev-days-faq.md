# Mixed Reality Dev Days FAQ

## BEFORE APPLYING

* **Who should apply? Is there criteria?**
    
    Weâ€™re passionate about welcoming a diverse developer community to Mixed Reality Dev Days. Weâ€™re also ensuring this event brings together developers from our large customers and partners, large studios, small studios, and individual developers.

    If you are a mixed reality developer looking to get training on our developer platform, tools, services and devices, we encourage you to join us at Mixed Reality Dev Days.

* **When will I know if I can attend?**

    [Applications](https://aka.ms/MRDevDayApplication) are open until noon PST on April 5, 2019. Depending on when you complete your application, you may be notified of your status as soon as April 5, 2019. Weâ€™re working hard to ensure all applicants are notified of their status by end of day on April 10, 2019. If we do not fill all the spots from this first wave of applicants, we may open applications for a second wave.

* **Why do I have to apply?**

    We have received high interest in this event and have a maximum capacity for the event. For this reason, weâ€™re asking that all developers interested complete this [application](https://aka.ms/MRDevDayApplication) so that we learn more about what youâ€™re working on and why youâ€™re interested.

* **I am in MRPP (Mixed Reality Partner Program). Can I send my team?**

    Weâ€™re glad you are interested in Mixed Reality Dev Days! Due to high interest and limited space, we encourage you to select one team member to apply, namely one of your mixed reality engineers, developers or designers. If thereâ€™s room for more of your team to attend, we will be sure to let you know. If you have any questions, please email [Nancy Li](mailto:nancli@microsoft.com).

    Please complete this [application](https://aka.ms/MRDevDayApplication) by noon Pacific Time (PST), April 5, 2019.

* **What's the difference between Mixed Reality Dev Days and Build?**

    We designed Mixed Reality Dev Days for YOU â€“ experts in mixed reality and the many aspects of cloud and AI technology that come with it, from computer vision to hologram creation. If you are a mixed reality developer looking to get training on our developer platform, tools, services and devices, Mixed Reality Dev Days is a great fit. 

    [Microsoft Build](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/build) brings developers and experts from product teams across the company together.
