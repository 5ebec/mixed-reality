# Share your idea

The Microsoft HoloLens community is bursting with spectacular ideas for how holographic computing will transform our world. We believe the most incredible HoloLens apps will come out of ideas you imagine together.

You shared over 5000 amazing ideas throughout those few weeks! Our development team reviewed the most successful and viable ideas and offered to build one of the top three ideas.

After a 24-hour Twitter poll, the results came in! Our HoloLens development team of designers, artists, and developers built [Galaxy Explorer](galaxy-explorer.md) and invited all of you to be part of this journey with them.

Now we’re done, we’ve open sourced the code so the HoloLens community can start building from it.

Be a part of the first community-sourced HoloLens experience.
