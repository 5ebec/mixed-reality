# Get started

Welcome to the world of mixed reality development! If you're new to MR, this guide will be your hub to get up and running as quickly as possible. We'll help you get your PC set up for development, get your device(s) ready, and install tools that will speed up the MR development process. 

## Intro to mixed reality

But first, you may have some questions about what we mean by "mixed reality" and how it relates to augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). In short, mixed reality is the blending of the physical world with the digital world, so it's a spectrum that covers everything from augmented reality, where digital content is placed in the real world, to virtual reality, where your real world is almost entirely replaced by the digital. 

We created Windows Mixed Reality as a single development platform and set of tools that can cover the MR spectrum, and we currently support two device types that cover the same spectrum: [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens), the world's first self-contained holographic headset, and [Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets and motion controllers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-mixed-reality), which connect to a PC for powerful virtual reality experiences. You can check out our What is [mixed reality?]( article for a more thorough answer if you're interested.

## Choose your development path

The easiest way to develop a mixed reality app is using [Unity](https://unity3d.com), a powerful and popular middleware tool often used for game development. If you want to use a custom engine, you can also [build against DirectX](directx-development-overview.md), but most MR developers use Unity for their games and apps.

## Learn more and get help

Now that you've successfully created your first MR project, you're probably hungry for more! Here are some resources that should help:
* [Mixed reality developer documentation](mixed-reality.md) - you're already here, but there's so much more to check out, including technical documentation, design guidance, sample projects, and case studies.
* [Mixed reality academy](academy.md) - follow along with tutorials covering everything from setting up projects, to implementing core MR building blocks, to integrating Azure cloud services into your MR app.
* [Learn Unity](https://unity3d.com/learn) - Unity's website offers tutorials, projects, and live training sessions for creators at every stage of learning.

You can also get help from these great community resources:
* [Mixed reality developer forums](https://forums.hololens.com/) - the official forum for mixed reality developers to ask and answer questions, as well as read MR development news straight from Microsoft.
* [HoloDevelopers Slack channel](https://holodevelopersslack.azurewebsites.net/) - the most robust and resourceful external mixed reality-specific developer channel; the devs here are knowledgeable and helpful.
* [Unity forums](https://forum.unity3d.com/) - Unity's official forums.
