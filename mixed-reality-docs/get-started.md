# Get started

Welcome to the world of mixed reality development! If you're new to MR, or new to development in general, this guide will your hub to get up and running as quickly as possible. We'll help you get your PC set up for development, get your device(s) ready, and install tools that will speed up the MR development process. But first, you may have some questions about what we mean by "mixed reality" and how it relates to augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). In short, mixed reality is the blending of the physical world with the digital world, so it's a spectrum that covers everything from augmented reality, where digital content is placed in the real world, to virtual reality, where your real world is almost entirely replaced by the digital. We created Windows Mixed Reality as a single development platform and set of tools that can cover that same spectrum, and we currently have two device types that complement each other on the mixed reality spectrum: [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens), the world's first self-contained holographic headset, and [Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets and motion controllers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-mixed-reality), which connect to a PC for powerful virtual reality experiences.
