Build a cross-platform, full-featured mixed reality app with Unity. We recommend the Unity LTS (Long Term Support) stream as the best version to use when starting new projects, updating to its latest revision to pick up the latest stable fixes. 
* The current recommendation is to use **Unity 2019**, which is the LTS build required for MRTK v2 below.
* If you need to use a different version of Unity for specific reasons, Unity supports side-by-side installs of different versions.

See the [Unity development overview](../unity-development-overview.md) to get started with Unity development for HoloLens 2 or Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets.

## What does Unity offer?

## Available hardware platforms

### HoloLens 

### Immersive headsets

## Available tools and SDKs

### [Microsoft’s Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) for Unity](../mrtk-getting-started.md)
The MRTK v2 with Unity is an open source cross-platform development kit for mixed reality applications. MRTK version 2 is intended to accelerate development of applications targeting Microsoft HoloLens, Windows Mixed Reality immersive (VR) headsets and OpenVR platform.

## Examples

We have several open source [sample apps](../samples.md) for you to download and play around with to get a feel for a Mixed Reality end product in Unity. There are also MRTK example scenes available for you to test out specific features:
* [Hand interaction examples scene (MRTK) for Unity](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/GettingStartedWithTheMRTK.html#open-and-run-the-handinteractionexamples-scene-in-editor)
The HandInteractionExamples.unity example scene contains various types of interactions and UI controls that highlight articulated hand input.

* [Eye tracking examples (MRTK) for Unity](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/EyeTracking/EyeTracking_ExamplesOverview.html)
This page covers how to get quickly started with using eye tracking in MRTK by building on our provided MRTK eye tracking examples.

>[!NOTE]
>Both of the MRTK example scenes require MRTK Foundation and Example Unity packages to be installed.
