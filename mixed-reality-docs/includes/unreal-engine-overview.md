## Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK)
![MRTK](../images/UX/MRTK_UX_Hero.png)

Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) is an open-source, cross-platform development kit for mixed reality applications. MRTK provides a cross-platform input system, foundational components, and common building blocks for spatial interactions. The toolkit is intended to accelerate the development of applications targeting Microsoft HoloLens, Windows Mixed Reality immersive (VR) headsets, and the OpenVR platform.

### Other tools
* <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityCompanionKit" target="_blank">Mixed Reality Companion Kit (GitHub)</a> - code bits and components that might not run directly on HoloLens or immersive (VR) headsets, but instead pair with them to build experiences targeting Windows Mixed Reality.
* <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit" target="_blank">Mixed Reality Toolkit - Common (GitHub)</a> - a collection of shared scripts and components.


## Setting up your PC for mixed reality development

The Windows 10 SDK works best on the Windows 10 operating system. This SDK is also supported on Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2. Note that not all tools are supported on older operating systems. 

### For HoloLens development

When setting up your development PC for HoloLens development, please make sure it meets the system requirements for both <a href="https://unity3d.com/unity/system-requirements" target="_blank">Unity</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//visualstudio/releases/2019/system-requirements" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a>. If you plan to use the HoloLens emulator, you'll want to make sure your PC meets the [HoloLens emulator system requirements](../using-the-hololens-emulator.md#hololens-emulator-system-requirements) as well.

To get started with the HoloLens emulator, see [Using the HoloLens emulator](../using-the-hololens-emulator.md).

If you plan to develop for both HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality immersive (VR) headsets, use the system recommendations and requirements in the section below.

### For immersive (VR) headset development

>[!NOTE]
>The following guidelines are the current minimum and recommended specs for your immersive (VR) headset *development PC*, and are updated regularly.

>[!WARNING]
>Do not confuse this with the [minimum PC hardware compatibility guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/windows-mixed-reality-minimum-pc-hardware-compatibility-guidelines), which outlines the *consumer PC specs* to which you should target your immersive (VR) headset app or game.

If your immersive headset development PC does not have full-sized HDMI and/or USB 3.0 ports, you'll need [adapters](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/recommended-adapters-for-windows-mixed-reality-capable-pcs) to connect your headset.

There are currently [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/troubleshooting-windows-mixed-reality) with some hardware configurations, particularly notebooks that have hybrid graphics.
