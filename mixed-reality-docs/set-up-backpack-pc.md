# Windows Mixed Reality with Backpack PC

Windows Mixed Reality Headset can be used with Backpack PCs to create an untethered experience for end users. 
Previously, a display emulator is required to use WMR with backpack PC. With the Fall update, we have removed this requirement and added functionalities to enable more scenarios with Backpack PC. 

## Running Windows Mixed Reality on Backpack PC 
You must have Mixed Reality Portal application running in order to use Windows Mixed Reality Headset.
You can manually start Mixed Reality Portal from the Desktop with the Backpack PC docked (connected to an external display with input device). Alternatively, you can configure your PC to auto start Windows Mixed Reality on boot, see next section for requirements and instructions. 


## Auto Start Windows Mixed Reality on PC Boot 
If you can configure your PC to auto start WMR when the PC boots, by using the two supported windows features: Auto logon, and designate Startup App.
