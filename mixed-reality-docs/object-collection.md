# Object collection

Object collection is a layout control which helps you lay out an array of objects in a predefined three-dimensional shape. It supports four different surface styles - **plane, cylinder, sphere** and **scatter**. You can adjust the radius and size of the objects and the space between them. Object collection supports any object from Unity - both 2D and 3D. In **[Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/blob/master/Assets/HoloToolkit-Examples/UX/Readme/README_ObjectCollection.md)**, we have created Unity script and [example scene](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/blob/master/Assets/HoloToolkit-Examples/UX/Scenes/ObjectCollectionExample.unity) that will help you create an object collection.

## Object collection examples

[Periodic Table of the Elements](periodic-table-of-the-elements.md) is a sample app that demonstrates how Object collection works. It uses Object collection to lay out 3D chemical element boxes in different shapes.

### 3D objects

You can use Object collection to lay out imported 3D objects. The example below shows a plane and a cylinder layout of some 3D chair objects.

### 2D objects

You can also use 2D images with Object collection. The examples below demonstrate how 2D images can be displayed in a grid.
