# Near menu

![Near menu](images/UX/UX_Hero_NearMenu.jpg)

Near menu is a collection of the buttons on a panel that follows you with tag-along behavior. It stays in a certain range of distance and angle to allow you to interact with content. You can use the pin button or grab and place the menu to make it world-locked and disable the tag-along behavior. This allows you to focus on the target content without being disturbed by the floating menu.

You can re-enable the tag-along by pressing the pin button and make the menu follow you again.
