# What can I do with HoloLens offline

You must be connected to a Wi-Fi network the first time you turn on your HoloLens and set it up. After you have completed initial setup, HoloLens can be used without an active WiFi / internet connection, but with the limitations below.

## Spaces

HoloLens uses WiFi to help identify the space you are in. If you are using HoloLens in an already-used space, you can manually load the space in Settings. Go to Settings > System > Spaces, select the space you want, and then select Load space.

If you are using HoloLens in a new space and are not connected to a WiFi network, you can use HoloLens in Limited Mode. Limited Mode prevents holograms from being placed in your world. In Limited Mode, holograms are fixed to your gaze.

## Cortana

Cortana requires an internet connection for use, so will be unable to respond to most inquiries.

## Dictation

The mic button above the standard on-screen keyboard will be disabled when your HoloLens is not connected to a WiFi network.

## Apps

Some apps may require an active WiFi and internet connection for use. Each app has different capabilities to be used offline.

## Update

HoloLens system updates and app updates will not be downloaded when the system is not connected to the internet over WiFi.
