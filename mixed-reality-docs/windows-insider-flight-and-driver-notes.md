# Windows Insider flight and driver notes

We have removed the Windows Insider build history leading up to the launch of Windows Mixed Reality as the archive of flight and driver notes has led to some confusion within the development community. To see a record of post-launch Windows Mixed Reality headset and motion controller driver updates, please visit the [Windows Mixed Reality Enthusiast's Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/mixed-reality-software).
