# Feature samples

The feature samples listed below correspond to specific implementations that are covered in our documentation and covers a range of development platforms and hardware devices. 

## Research Mode

Research Mode was introduced in the 1st Generation HoloLens to give access to key sensors on the device, specifically for research applications that are not intended for deployment. The sample applications below are examples for accessing and recording Research Mode streams and using the [intrinsics and extrinsics](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/locatable-camera#locating-the-device-camera-in-the-world).

| [Research Mode](research-mode.md) | [HoloLens 2](https://github.com/microsoft/HoloLens2ForCV/tree/main/Samples) |

## QR codes

HoloLens 2 can detect QR codes in the environment around the headset, establishing a coordinate system at each code's real-world location.

## WebRTC

The MixedReality-WebRTC project is a collection of components to help mixed reality app developers to integrate peer-to-peer audio, video, and data real-time communication into their applications WebRTC components are based on the WebRTC protocol for Real-Time Communication (RTC), which is supported by most modern web browsers.

## Holographic Mixed Reality Capture

Mixed reality capture (MRC) captures the first-person experience of mixing real and digital worlds as a photo or video, sharing what you see with others in real-time.

## Holographic Remoting

The Holographic Remoting Player is a companion app that connects to PC apps and games that support Holographic Remoting. Holographic Remoting streams holographic content from a PC to your Microsoft HoloLens in real-time, using a Wi-Fi connection, and is supported on HoloLens (1st gen) and HoloLens 2.
