# Mixed Reality Learning overview

Microsoft Learn is a free, online training platform that provides interactive learning for Microsoft products and more. Our goal is to help you become proficient on our technologies and learn more skills with fun, hands-on interactive content that's specific to your role and goals. If you want to know more about Microsoft Learn, check out our introduction [video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/One-Dev-Minute/What-is-Microsoft-Learn).

<!-- The MR Learning Modules are an updated approach to teaching developers how to create applications for the Mixed Reality Platform and devices, based on learnings from the original Academy tutorial series. Some examples of feedback we wanted to address with this new series include:

* Tutorials don't implement or show how to use the Mixed Reality Toolkit
* The tutorials are great for learning how to implement one thing, but not for building an application
* There is not really any UI guidance available

With that feedback in hand, we set out to design a set of tutorials that would not only address the above items, but also will give all developers a useful baseline code template to begin from. -->
