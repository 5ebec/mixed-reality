# Debug your app with Holographic Remoting

You can use Holographic Remoting to preview and debug your app during the development process. This provides a way to quickly debug your app without building and deploying a full project. To learn more, see [Holographic Remoting overview](../platform-capabilties-and-apis/holographic-remoting-overview.md) and [Preview and debug your app with Holographic Remoting and Play mode](preview-and-debug-your-app.md).
