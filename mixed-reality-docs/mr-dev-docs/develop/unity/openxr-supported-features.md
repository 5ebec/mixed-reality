## What's coming soon

The following issues and missing features are known with Mixed Reality OpenXR plugin **version 0.1.0**. We're working on these and will release fixes and new features in upcoming releases.

* When you suspend and resume a Unity app on HoloLens 2, the app can't correctly resume, which leads to 4 spinning dots in the HoloLens view. 
    *  Set **Depth submission Mode** to **None** in the OpenXR project settings as a workaround
* **ARPlaneSubsystem** is not supported yet. **ARPlaneManager**, **ARHittestManager**, and related API like **ARAnchorManager.AttachAnchor** are also not supported on HoloLens 2.
* **Anchor** isn't supported by Holographic remoting yet, but it's coming in the near future.
