For developers targeting Unity 2020, the Windows XR plugin enables access to mixed reality features on HoloLens 2 and Windows Mixed Reality headsets.  This plugin is also supported on Unity 2019, although there are some known incompatibilities with Azure Spatial Anchors when using this plugin on that version.

While Microsoft and the community have created opensource tools such as the [Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK)](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/Installation.html) that will automatically set up the WMR environment, many developers wish to build their experiences from the ground up.
