# Choosing a Unity version and XR plugin

While we currently recommend installing **Unity 2019.4 LTS and the Built-in XR plugin** for Mixed Reality development, you can also build Mixed Reality apps with other Unity configurations. 

## Unity 2019.4 LTS + Built-in XR (recommended) 

Microsoft’s current recommended Unity configuration for Mixed Reality development is Unity 2019.4 LTS with the Built-in XR plugin. The best way to install and manage Unity is through the [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). 

## Unity 2019.4 LTS + XR SDK 

While you can use XR SDK with Unity 2019 LTS...

## Unity 2020.3 LTS + Windows XR Plugin 

If you’re using Unity 2020.3 LTS, Mixed Reality support is available to develop HoloLens 2 applications. However, there are currently some known issues.  This will become the recommended Unity version later this year. 

<!-- ## Known issues  -->

## Unity 2020 LTS + OpenXR Plugin 

## Unity 2021.1 

* In Unity 2021.1, you should move to the OpenXR plugin, as the Windows XR plugin is deprecated. 
* In Unity 2021.2, OpenXR will be the only path for Mixed Reality development and Windows XR will be removed.
