# HP Reverb G2 Controllers in Unity

Need introductions...

## Getting started

There's no additional setup required to use the HP Reverb G2 controller if you're developing for SteamVR or using the Windows Mixed Reality Input API (XR.WSA.Input). However, the A, B, X, Y buttons and the squeeze trigger are not currently accessible through the Input Manager unless you're using SteamVR. Support for the extra Reverb G2 inputs will be available in the near future, so be sure to check back!

## Porting existing applications

If you already have an existing app that you're developing for Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets, check out our [porting guide](../porting-apps/porting-guides) and [project settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/develop/porting-apps/porting-guides?tabs=project#unity-porting-guidance) sections for general suggestions.

## Mapping input

When you're ready to get your input mapping up and running for your new controllers, start at the [input mapping](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/develop/porting-apps/porting-guides?tabs=input#unity-porting-guidance) section of the immersive porting guide. Instructions on how to configure inputs in Unity is detailed in [Gestures and motion controllers](gestures-and-motion-controllers-in-unity.md), along with a full [button and axis mapping table](gestures-and-motion-controllers-in-unity.md#using-hp-reverb-g2-controllers) for reference.
