* Asus HC102
* Acer OJO 500

## Available tools and SDKs

|  Tool/SDK  |  Description  |
| --- | --- |
| [Mixed Reality Toolkit for Unity](../unity/mrtk-getting-started.md) | The Mixed Reality Toolkit for Unity is an open source cross-platform development kit built to accelerate development of applications targeting Microsoft HoloLens, Windows Mixed Reality immersive (VR) headsets and OpenVR platform. |
| [Microsoft World Locking Tools](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedReality-WorldLockingTools-Unity/DocGen/Documentation/GettingStartedWithWorldLocking.html) | Provides a stable coordinate system and camera adjustment that minimizes the visible inconsistencies. |
| [Microsoft Mesh](/mesh/overview) Private Preview | Complete the [Microsoft Mesh Register Interest](https://aka.ms/meshsignup) form to stay up to date with Mesh announcements and news. With Mesh, you can enhance virtual meetings, conduct virtual design sessions, help others remotely, and host virtual meet-ups. |

## Cloud services

There are several cloud services that can be integrated into Mixed Reality projects built in Unity, specifically **Azure Remote Rendering** and **Azure Spatial Anchors**. These services can add shared holographic content and real-time 3D rendering to your applications, making them more compelling and immersive for your users.

All of these services are covered over the course of the [Unity development for HoloLens journey](../unity/unity-development-overview.md), which is the **strongly recommended path for learning Mixed Reality with Unity**. You're already on this path, so just keep reading and follow the big blue button at the bottom of the article. However, if you're at a more advanced development stage and already know you want to jump in, check out our [cloud services overview](../mixed-reality-cloud-services.md) or go directly to the [services resources](../unity/unity-development-overview.md#5-adding-services).

## Dynamics 365 Guides

You can use **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides** to visually tether holographic instructions to your apps virtual environment, giving your users important information when and where it's needed. This feature is also covered in the Unity development for HoloLens journey, but if you want to jump ahead you can see what's on offer by selecting the **Dynamics 365** tab [here](../unity/unity-development-overview.md#5-adding-services).

# [Unreal](#tab/unreal)

![Unreal banner](../images/unreal_logo_banner.png)

Build a cross-platform, full-featured mixed reality app with Unreal. See the [Unreal development overview](../unreal/unreal-development-overview.md) to get started with Unreal development for HoloLens.

## Available hardware platforms

You have several hardware, emulator, and streaming options when building Mixed Reality apps with Unreal Engine. While our developer documentation focuses on HoloLens devices, you can package your Unreal projects as x64 desktop apps and run them on immersive headsets just fine.

**Augmented reality devices**
* [HoloLens (1st Gen)](/hololens/hololens1-hardware)
* [HoloLens 2](/hololens/hololens2-hardware)

**Immersive VR headsets**
* HP Reverb and Reverb G2
* Samsung Odyssey and Odyssey+
* HP Windows Mixed Reality headset

## Available tools and SDKs

|  Tool/SDK  |  Description  |
| --- | --- |
| [UX Tools for Unreal](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unreal) | UX Tools is the first plugin to be released and is currently only supported on HoloLens 2. The plugin includes C++ code, Blueprints, and example assets of common UX features for input simulation, hand interactions, surface magnetism and more. |
| [Graphics Tools for Unreal](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-GraphicsTools-Unreal/) | Graphics Tools is a UE game plugin with code, blueprints and example assets created to help improve the visual fidelity of Mixed Reality applications while staying within performance budgets. |

## Cloud services

When building Mixed Reality apps in Unreal, you have access to a powerful cloud service called **Azure Spatial Anchors**, which you can use to add, persist, and share holographic content across different devices. 

Azure Spatial Anchors is covered over the course of the [Unreal development journey](../unreal/unreal-development-overview.md), which is the **strongly recommended path for learning Mixed Reality with Unreal**. You're already on this path, so just keep reading and follow the big blue button at the bottom of the article. However, if you're at a more advanced development stage and already know you want to jump in, check out our [cloud services overview](../mixed-reality-cloud-services.md) or go directly to the [services resources](../unreal/unreal-development-overview.md#5-adding-services).

## Dynamics 365 Guides

You can use **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides** to visually tether holographic instructions to your apps virtual environment, giving your users important information when and where it's needed. This feature is also covered in the Unreal development journey, but if you want to jump ahead you can see what's on offer by selecting the **Dynamics 365** tab [here](../unreal/unreal-development-overview.md#5-adding-services).

# [JavaScript](#tab/web)

![Web](../images/javascript_logo_banner.png)

The WebXR Device API is an open specification that allows you to experience Mixed Reality apps in your browser on any platform. See the [JavaScript development overview](../javascript/javascript-development-overview.md) to get started building Mixed Reality apps for any platform.

# [Native (OpenXR)](#tab/native)

![Native](../images/native_logo_banner.png)

Create mixed reality apps with a direct line to the Windows Mixed Reality APIs. See the [Native development overview](../native/directx-development-overview.md) to get started with native app development using OpenXR or legacy WinRT for HoloLens 2 or Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets. The Windows Mixed Reality API supports applications written in C++ and C#, allowing you to build your own framework or middleware in either language.

## Available hardware platforms

You have several hardware, emulator, and streaming options when building Mixed Reality apps with OpenXR development.
