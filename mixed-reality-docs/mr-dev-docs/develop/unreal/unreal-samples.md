# Unreal sample apps

![HoloLens 2 user](images/unreal-developer.jpg)

## HoloLens 2 open source sample apps

Most of the open source sample apps made by our team can be found in the Unreal Mixed Reality Samples [repository](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-Unreal-Samples) on GitHub. We have provided the source code so that developers can look at, learn from, and reuse our projects.

* [HoloLens2Example](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-Unreal-Samples/tree/master/HoloLens2Example) 
* [HoloPipes](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-Unreal-HoloPipes) - Download from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surfaces/9nvkpv3sk3x0) in HoloLens 2

### Made with the Mixed Reality Toolkit for Unreal

A subset of the samples makes use of interactive UX components such as buttons and sliders provided the [UX Tools plugin](https://aka.ms/uxt-unreal) of the [Mixed Reality Toolkit for Unreal](https://aka.ms/mrtk-unreal).

* [Chess App](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-Unreal-Samples/tree/master/ChessApp)
* [Kippy's Escape](unreal-kippys-escape.md) - Download from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/kippys-escape/9nbd7gl86vkd) in HoloLens 2

### Made by Epic Games

Our partners at Epic Games have released an excellent HoloLens 2 sample project on the Unreal Marketplace. Note that this experience must be streamed from a high-end PC to the headset.
