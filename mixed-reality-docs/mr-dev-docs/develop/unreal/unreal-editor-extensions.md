# Editor extensions in Unreal

Unreal provides an extensive set of features that allow you to customize the engine to your needs. The features range from simple but limited, to very powerful but complex. The following steps are listed in order of increasing complexity. In general, you should reach for simpler solutions to your problem, and exhausting its options, before moving to a more complex option. As an example, we have found that the basic Construction Script can be used in lieu of plugins most of the time. Also, engine modification should be a last resort, as it is not only complex, but integrating changes back into the engine for simple work-around can take a disproportionately long time.

## Construction scripts

## Scripted actions

## Editor utility widgets

## Plugins

## Engine modifications
