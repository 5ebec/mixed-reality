The hand meshes can be used for various reasons, primarily in debug purposes. The recommended way to visualize hand mesh is to use Epicâ€™s XRVisualization plugin together with Microsoft-OpenXR-Unreal. 

Then in the blueprint editor, you should use **Set Use Hand Mesh** function from Microsoft-OpenXR-Unreal with **Enabled XRVisualization** as a parameter:

To manage the rendering process, you should use **Render Motion Controller** from XRVisualization:

The result:
