The previous section describes a simple but not configurable way to show hand meshes. If you need anything more complicated, such as drawing a hand mesh with a custom shader, you need to get the meshes as a tracked geometry. 

To enable that mode you should call **Set Use Hand Mesh** with **Enabled Tracking Geometry**:
