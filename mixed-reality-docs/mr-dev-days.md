## Code of Conduct and Microsoft Standard Event Guidelines

### Code of Conduct (Coming Soon)

### Microsoft Standard Event Guidelines

### Microsoft's mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. This includes Microsoft parties where we seek to create a respectful, friendly, fun and inclusive experience for all participants.

### We do not tolerate harassing or disrespectful behavior, messages, images, or interactions by any party participant, in any form, at any aspect of the program including business and social activities, regardless of location.

### We do not tolerate any behavior that is degrading to any gender, race, sexual orientation or disability, or any behavior that would violate the company's Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination Policy, Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, or Standards of Business Conduct, even if the entertainment is not paid for by Microsoft. In short, the entire experience at the venue must meet our culture standards.

### We encourage everyone to assist in creating a welcoming and safe environment. Please report any concerns, harassing behavior, or suspicious or disruptive activity to venue staff, the event host or owner, or the nearest event staff. We also encourage employees to contact their Microsoft Manager or our Business Conduct Hotline (1-877-320-MSFT or [buscond@microsoft.com](mailto:buscond@microsoft.com)) at any time if you feel a party is against our policy or inconsistent with the Microsoft culture. Outside the United States, call collect to 1-470-219-7087.

### Microsoft reserves the right to refuse admittance to, or remove any person from a party at any time at its sole discretion.

### We make this policy visible for all Microsoft parties so all attendees can see what is expected and what steps they should take if they see or experience behavior not consistent with this policy

## Frequently Asked Questions
This section will be updated frequently as we get more questions from you!

**Q** - Can I participate without a VR Headset?  
**A** - Absolutely. While we feel the event will be best experienced with a VR Headset, we want to be inclusive of people who can't join us in that format.

**Q** - How do I join the 2D experience?  
**A** - From a PC you have the option to [download the Altspace Client](https://altvr.com/get-altspacevr/) via the Windows Store or Steam.

Info on how to navigate within the 2D experience can be found [here](https://help.altvr.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003528373-How-do-I-control-my-avatar-with-Mouse-Keyboard-).
