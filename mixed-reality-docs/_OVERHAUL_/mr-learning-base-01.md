# 1. Introduction

## Overview

Welcome to the Getting Started tutorials! Through this tutorial series, you will learn about some of the features the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity" target="_blank"> Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK)</a> has to offer while building a mixed reality experience where the user can explore a hologram modelled after NASA's Mars Curiosity Rover.

Tutorials in this series:

* [Initializing your project and first application](mr-learning-base-02.md) - You will start your first application for the HoloLens 2, and deploy it to the device.
* [Configure the Mixed Reality Toolkit](mr-learning-base-03.md) - You will learn how to configure the MRTK profile giving greater flexibility in the applications you can create.
* [Positioning objects in scene](mr-learning-base-04.md) - You will learn about positioning 3D objects for Mixed Reality applications.
* [Scene understanding](mr-learning-base-05.md) - You will learn the basics of scene understanding.
* [Interacting with 3D objects](mr-learning-base-06.md) - You will learn the different ways of interacting with 3D objects.
* [Adding tooltips to scene](mr-learning-base-07.md) - You will learn how to set up tooltips and how useful they are.
* [Creating user interface](mr-learning-base-08.md) - You will learn how to set up UI with MRTK assets or how to replace MRTK assets with your own.
* [Using solvers](mr-learning-base-09.md) - You will learn the massive potential of solvers and how to use them.
* [Using Voice Commands](mr-learning-base-10.md) - You will learn how to set up custom voice commands.
* [Using eye Tracking](mr-learning-base-11.md) - You will learn how to use eye tracking.
* [Functionality to drive rover](mr-learning-base-12.md) - You will finalize the app you have been build to this point.
* [Build your application to a mobile device](mr-learning-base-13.md) - You will learn how to build an MRTK project to a mobile device.
