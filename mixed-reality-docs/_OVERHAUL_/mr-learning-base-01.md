## Overview
<!-- TODO: update wording to match the tutorials -->
Welcome to the first series of Hololens 2 tutorials. In this twelve-part series you will learn about some of the capabilities the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity" target="_blank"> Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK)</a> has to offer and the fundamentals of building an application for Hololens 2.

<!-- TODO: Consider new format "In [leason-name](leason-link) tutorial, you will..."-->
In the first tutorial [Initializing your project and first application](mr-learning-base-02.md), you will start your first application for the HoloLens 2, and deploy it to the device.

In the second tutorial [Configure the Mixed Reality Toolkit](mr-learning-base-03.md), you will learn how to configure the MRTK profile giving greater flexibility in the applications you can create.

In the third tutorial [Positioning objects in scene](mr-learning-base-04.md), you will learn about positioning 3D objects for Mixed Reality applications.

In the forth tutorial [Scene understanding](mr-learning-base-05.md), you will learn the basics of scene understanding.

In the fifth tutorial [Interacting with 3D objects](mr-learning-base-06.md), you will learn the different ways of interacting with 3D objects.

In the sixth tutorial [Adding tooltips to scene](mr-learning-base-07.md), you will learn how to set up tooltips and how useful they are.

In the seventh tutorial [Creating user interface](mr-learning-base-08.md), you will learn how to set up UI with MRTK assets or how to replace MRTK assets with your own.

In the eighth tutorial [Using solvers](mr-learning-base-09.md), you will learn the massive potential of solvers and how to use them.

In the Ninth tutorial [Using Voice Commands](mr-learning-base-10.md), you will learn how to set up custom voice commands.

In the tenth tutorial [Using eye Tracking](mr-learning-base-11.md), you will learn how to use eye tracking.

In the eleventh tutorial [Functionality to drive rover](mr-learning-base-12.md), you finalize the app you have been build to this point.

In the twelfth tutorial [Build your application to a mobile device](mr-learning-base-13.md), you will learn how to build an MRTK project to a mobile device.

## Objectives

<!-- TODO: Update to exact wording used in the following tutorials' Objectives section and add any missing objectives -->
* Configure Unity for HoloLens development
* Import assets and set up the scene
* Visualization of the spatial mapping mesh, hand meshes, and the framerate counter
* Customize and configure Mixed Reality Toolkit profiles
* Create a panel of 3D objects which will be used for the other learning objectives
* Implement bounding boxes
* Configure 3D objects for basic manipulation such as move, rotate, and scale
* Explore near and far interaction
* Learn about additional hand tracking gestures, such as grab and touch
* Interact with holograms using UI elements and buttons
* Basic hand-tracking input and interactions
* Introduce the MRTK's Solvers
* Use Solvers to have a collection of buttons follow the user
* Use Solvers to have a game object follow the user's tracked hands
* Trigger events using voice commands and keywords
* Use tracked hands to pan textures and 3D objects with tracked hands
* Leverage HoloLens 2 eye tracking capabilities to select objects
* Combine multiple concepts from previous lessons to create a unique experience
* Learn how to toggle objects
* Trigger complex events using pressable buttons
* Use rigidbody physics and forces
* Explore the use of tool tips

## Prerequisites

* A Windows 10 PC configured with the correct [tools installed](install-the-tools.md)
* Windows 10 SDK 10.0.18362.0 or later
* A HoloLens 2 device [configured for development](using-visual-studio.md#enabling-developer-mode)
* <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingHub.html" target="_blank">Unity Hub</a> with Unity 2019.3.X installed and the Universal Windows Platform Build Support module added

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The recommended Unity version for this tutorial series is Unity 2019.3.X. This supersedes any Unity version requirements or recommendations stated in the prerequisites linked above.
