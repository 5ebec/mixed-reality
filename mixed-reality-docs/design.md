# Start designing and prototyping

## What are the core building blocks of an experience?


![distance guide](images/text_in_unity_viewingangle.jpg)

### [What is the user looking at? - (Gaze)](gaze.md)
Gaze is the first form of input and is a primary form of targeting within mixed reality. Gaze tells you where the user is looking in the world and lets you determine their intent

### [Taking action in mixed reality - (Gestures)](gestures.md)
Hand gestures allow users take action in mixed reality. Interaction is built on gaze to target and gesture or voice to act upon whatever element has been targeted.

### [Keep the user comfortable - (Comfort)](comfort.md)
To ensure maximum comfort on head-mounted displays, it’s important for designers and developers to create and present content in a way that mimics how these cues operate in the natural world.

### [How the user sees the world - (Holographic frame)](holographic-frame.md)
Users see the world of mixed reality through a rectangular viewport powered by their headset. On the HoloLens, this rectangular area is called the holographic frame and allows users to see digital content overlaid onto the real world around them.

### [Making holographic objects feel real - (Spatial mapping)](spatial-mapping.md)
Spatial mapping makes it possible to place objects on real surfaces. This helps anchor objects in the user's world and takes advantage of real world depth cues.

### [Suggesting the scale of an object - (Scale)](scale.md)
A key to displaying content that looks realistic in holographic form is to mimic the visual statistics of the real world as closely as possible. This means incorporating as many of the visual cues as we can that help us (in the real world) understand where objects are, how big they are, and what they’re made of.

## Interaction design factors to consider

### [Expanding the design process for mixed reality](case-study-expanding-the-design-process-for-mixed-reality.md)

As Microsoft launched the HoloLens to an audience of eager developers in 2016, the team had already partnered with studios inside and outside of Microsoft to build the device’s launch experiences. These teams learned by doing, finding both opportunities and challenges in the new field of mixed reality design.

### [Types of mixed reality apps](types-of-mixed-reality-apps.md)

One of the advantages of developing apps for Windows Mixed Reality is that there is a spectrum of experiences that the platform can support. From fully immersive, virtual environments, to light information layering over a user’s current environment, Windows Mixed Reality provides a robust set of tools to bring any experience to life.

### [Choose an interaction model for your customer](interaction-fundamentals.md)

The philosophy of simple, instinctual interactions is interwoven throughout the Mixed Reality platform. We've taken three steps to ensure that application designers and developers can provide their customers with easy and intuitive interactions.

### [Typography](typography.md)

Just like typography on 2D screens, the goal is to be clear and readable. With the three-dimensional aspect of mixed reality, there is an opportunity to affect the text and the overall user experience in an even greater way.

### [Voice input](voice-input.md)

Voice is one of the three key forms of input on HoloLens. It allows you to directly command a hologram without having to use gestures. You simply gaze at a hologram and speak your command. 

### [Billboarding and tag-along](billboarding-and-tag-along.md)

Billboarding is a behavioral concept that can be applied to objects in mixed reality. Objects with billboarding always orient themselves to face the user. This is especially helpful with text and menuing systems where static objects placed in the user's environment (world-locked) would be otherwise obscured or unreadable if a user were to move around.

## Prototyping options

*TBD Need help here – What’s the best way to transition in prototyping? Describe the options? Install the tools? What and why?*


[![Mixed Reality Toolkit logo](images/mrtklogo-1000px.png)](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/GettingStartedWithTheMRTK.html)

### [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/GettingStartedWithTheMRTK.html)

Get a better understanding of what defines mixed reality and how it’s being used.


### [Sample apps](tutorials.md#open-source-sample-apps)

The open source sample apps are applications that have been created by our teams and we have provided the source code so that developers could look at it and learn from our projects. 


### [Microsoft Maquette](https://www.maquette.ms/)

Microsoft Maquette makes spatial prototyping easy, quick, and immersive.
