## Unity


### [Unity development overview](unity-development-overview.md)
The fastest path to building a mixed reality app is with Unity. We recommend that you take time to explore the Unity tutorials. If you need assets, Unity has a comprehensive Asset Store. 

<br>

### [Microsoft’s Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) for Unity](mrtk-getting-started.md)
The MRTK v2 with Unity is an open source cross-platform development kit for mixed reality applications. MRTK version 2 is intended to accelerate development of applications targeting Microsoft HoloLens, Windows Mixed Reality immersive (VR) headsets and OpenVR platform.

<br>

### [Open source sample apps and step-by-step tutorials](tutorials.md)
The HoloLens 2 tutorials are designed to help developers learn both techniques and best practices for developing mixed reality applications. The tutorials are based on the Mixed Reality Toolkit 2.0 (MRTK 2.0).

<br>

### [Example Unity scenes in MRTK](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/README_HandInteractionExamples.html)
The HandInteractionExamples.unity example scene contains various types of interactions and UI controls that highlight articulated hand input
