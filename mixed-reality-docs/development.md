## [How is mixed reality development different?](case-study-expanding-the-design-process-for-mixed-reality.md)

As Microsoft launched the HoloLens to an audience of eager developers in 2016, the team had already partnered with studios inside and outside of Microsoft to build the device’s launch experiences. These teams learned by doing, finding both opportunities and challenges in the new field of mixed reality design.

## Unity


### [Unity development overview](unity-development-overview.md)
The fastest path to building a mixed reality app is with Unity. We recommend that you take time to explore the Unity tutorials. If you need assets, Unity has a comprehensive Asset Store. 
<br>

### [Microsoft’s Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) for Unity](mrtk-getting-started.md)
The MRTK v2 with Unity is an open source cross-platform development kit for mixed reality applications. MRTK version 2 is intended to accelerate development of applications targeting Microsoft HoloLens, Windows Mixed Reality immersive (VR) headsets and OpenVR platform.
<br>

### [Open source sample apps and step-by-step tutorials](tutorials.md)
The HoloLens 2 tutorials are designed to help developers learn both techniques and best practices for developing mixed reality applications. The tutorials are based on the Mixed Reality Toolkit 2.0 (MRTK 2.0).
<br>

### [Example Unity scenes in MRTK](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/README_HandInteractionExamples.html)
The HandInteractionExamples.unity example scene contains various types of interactions and UI controls that highlight articulated hand input
